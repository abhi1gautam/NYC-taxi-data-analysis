Analysis of NYC Data- 2015 and 2016
==============================

This project involves analysing a large dataset (60 GB of CSVs) using PySpark. It includes extracting the data, performing cleaning and transformation, and then querying to get answers to a few business questions, and lastly building a machine learning model with to see how its predictions. The decisions undertaken while cleaning, performing transformations, problems encountered while dealing with the massive dataset and its solutions are described in the Report- Project Report.
